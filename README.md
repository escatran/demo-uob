## About the demo: ##
    * employee-data-service: provides 2 API to check whether the employee exists by the phone number. This field is unique.
    * employee: provides 1 API to check/create employee. Using Camel DSL in EmployeeRouter to route the request to employee-data-service's API.
    * employee-zuul: works as an API gateway for employee microservice. This implemented 2 ways SSL (mutual authentication) using JKS keystore which is generated by a tool called KeyStore Explorer(https://keystore-explorer.org/). Check the application.yml for details.
    * uob-client: this microservice works as the consumer of employee-zuul. This microservice will send request to employee-zull along with security info to authenticate. Check file UobClientApplication.java for details.
